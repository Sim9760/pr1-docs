# Using PR–1 for microfluidics

PR–1 is particularly well-suited for automating microfluidic setups.


## Pressurized channels

PR–1 is particularly well suited for automating microfluidic setups which consist in channels that are alternatively pressurized and unpressurized. A common method for achieving automation of such setups is to use relay boards.
