# Configuring a setup


## Introduction

We can define a configuration for the `mf.valves` units by listing its devices.

```yml
# ...
units:
  # ...
  mf.valves:
    devices:
      - driver: numato
        port: /dev/tty.usbmodem1101
```

Here, we defined a device on port `/dev/tty.usbmodem1101` with the Numato driver to control a [Numato relay module](https://numato.com/product/16-channel-usb-relay-module/). We can now define a number of valves available on that setup, and their corresponding relay number (aka channel).

```yml
devices:
  - driver: numato
    port: /dev/tty.usbmodem1101
    valves:
      - name: A1
        channel: 0
      - name: A2
        channel: 1
      - name: A3
        channel: 2
      - name: A4
        channel: 3
      - name: B1
        channel: 4
      - name: B2
        channel: 5
```

Other devices can be added to the configuration by appending to the `devices` list. As an example, we could have a device on the local network being remotely controlled.

```yml
devices:
  - driver: numato
    port: /dev/tty.usbmodem1101
    valves:
      # ...
  - driver: some_remote_driver
    address: 192.168.1.32
    valves:
      # ...
```


## Built-in drivers

- `numato` – Driver to control [Numato](https://numato.com/) relay modules, based on the RS-232 protocol and powered by [pySerial](https://github.com/pyserial/pyserial). Requires the following keys:
  - `port` – The serial port to use. Usually something like `/dev/tty.usbmodem1101` on *nix and `COM1` on Windows.
- `mock` – Driver to mock a device, useful for testing.


## Creating a driver

If you are using a device other than those with built-in drivers, you can create your own using a Python script. The `signal` value is a single integer which contains the status of every valve: bit 0 represents channel 0, bit 1 channel 1, etc.

```python
class Driver:
  # Define a set of keys that are allowed for the driver's configuration.
  keys = {}

  def from_spec(spec):
    # The driver's configuration will be contained in the 'spec' dictionary.
    # It is recommended to validate the configuration before using it.

    # Create a new driver instance.
    return Driver(...)


  def read(self):
    return get_signal_somehow()

  def write(self, signal):
    set_signal_somehow(signal)
```
